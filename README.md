Happy Holidays!

MKFactor and Klipper are proud to announce the 2024 holiday badge! 

Assembly Instructions:

Place the ESP32 module in the headers to keep them straight:

Place the pins through the back of the house to the front:

Solder the pins on the front:

Remove both screens from the packaging. You will use the straight pins (discard the 90 degree ones). The LONG side will be soldered on the BACK of the screens. The plastic part and shorter pins will be on the screen side:

Solder the long pins on the back of the screens. Setting them on a table can help:

Peel off that sweet, sweet, screen protection film:

Push the pins from the back to the front of the badge. They will be tight so it will require a bit of force. Make sure to apply force on the header pins and not the screens. Once it is pushed through, solder the pins on the front of the badge.

Remove the ESP32 module so you can access the pads to solder the button:

Push the button where the doorknow goes, and the pins will push through to the back of the door:

Place the minibadge headers on the front of the badge (the chimney)

Putting a minibadge in the headers can help keep things straight. Flip the badge over and solder the pins:

That's all there is to it! Fire up the badge and look for the wled-ap access point and the password is wled1234. Once you are connected, scan for your local wifi and join the badge to it. You can then update the code with the attached file by browsing to the settings.
